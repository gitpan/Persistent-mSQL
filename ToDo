o Add a Time datatype to the Persistent Base package so that times
  can be stored using this subclass.  Currently due to the limitations
  of the mSQL database, which does not provide a combined DateTime datatype,
  only the date is stored when using a Persistent DateTime datatype.

Please see the ToDo file for the Persistent DBI module for other
possible changes to this module.
